## City of Chicago Vendor Payments
This simple react application is built to request data from the Chicago data portal and visually render it in a way that's easy to digest. Users can see the aggregate payment about by vendor, or view the largest individual payments. This is accomplished by using the dropdown select menu and choosing the user's preferred query type.

## Running the Application
Launching the application is very easy and can be broken down into two steps.

1) Install dependencies: This can be accomplished with the following command:

$ yarn install

2) Start the application: In the command line input the following command:

$ yarn start

That's it! You should have a browser window displaying the information.

## What's this built with?
This application is built entirely with React.JS
